## Application Notes {#libtidy_05}

Of course, there are functions to parse and save both markup and configuration
files. For the adventurous, it is possible to create new input sources and
output sinks. For example, a URL source could pull the markup from a given URL.

It is also worth remembering that an application may instantiate **any
number** of document and buffer objects. They are fairly cheap to initialize
and destroy (just memory allocation and zeroing, really), so they may be created
and destroyed locally, as needed. There is no problem keeping them around a
while for keeping state. For example, a server app might keep a global document
as a master configuration. As documents are parsed, they can copy their
configuration data from the master instance. See `tidyOptCopyConfig()`. If the
master copy is initialized at startup, no synchronization is necessary.
